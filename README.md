# Predicting Salaries of Future Job Postings

## Introduction
How are salaries for specific job positions determined? Is it simply based on experience and type of position of potential job applicants, or is there more to it? I would like to investigate this question using data on present job postings, and their attached salaries. After exploring the data, I will develop a model and plot which features are the most important in determining salaries of newly posted posittions. The language of choice to tackle this problem is Python, using packages such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn.
