# Salary-Prediction
Salary Prediction Project (Python)

This is a project aimed for predicting future salaries of job postings based on salaries of current job postings. The language of choice to tackle this problem is Python.

After performing the exploratory data analysis, I fitted three models and compared their mean squared errors, basically comparing how well the models performed comparing to the baseline model, and also each other. The model performing the best with the train data was the gradient boosting model. I saved the model, scored the test data with it, and saved the results of the prediction in a csv file. I also included the analysis of feature importances, and saved it in a separate file.
